# Godot Particle Flipbook Smoothing
An example using flowmaps to smooth particle flipbooks in Godot

This shader uses a flowmap to interpolate flipbook animation frames for smoother flipbook playback.

I used one of the free CC0 flipbooks available here for my examples: https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/free-vfx-image-sequences-flipbooks

And I generated the flowmap with this free tool: https://www.facedownfx.com/
